|I used  Get Customer Input for initial input. (Amazon Lex Bot) 
                       |
|  - Prompt: "Welcome to InterVision Shopping. How can I assist 
     you today? Say 'Order,'        |
|    'Complaint,' or 'Inquiry.'"                              |
|  - Timeout: 30 seconds                                      |
|  - Timeout Prompt: "I'm sorry, I didn't hear your response. |
|    Can you please repeat that? Say 'Order,' 'Complaint,' or |
|    'Inquiry.'"                                              |
|  - Error Message: "I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could    |
|    you please repeat? Say 'Order,' 'Complaint,' or          |
|    'Inquiry.'"                                              |

+-----------------------------+                    
|I used Check Contact Attributes with conditions to route the call to the respective queues or Lambda Function: the condition is:   |                    
|  - If "customerIntent Equals 'Order'" → Invoke Lambda and process the order based on the information the customer will give.   
|  - If "customerIntent Equals 'Complaint'" → Set Working Queue, Agent Douglas Smith will answer the call and disconnect it at the end.
|  - If "customerIntent Equals 'Inquiry'" → Set Working Queue, Agent John Perry will answer the call and disconnect it at the end.
